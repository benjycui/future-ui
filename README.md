# Future UI

A list of ideas that may be useful while developing a React UI library.

## Motivation

As a maintainer of [`antd`](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design), I learn a lot while maintaining it. And I totally know that `antd` is a good React UI library, but not a perfect one. So I create this repository to write some notes on my dream UI library and to discuss with others.

I will write down good parts of `antd` that I found, and solutions(which may not apply to `antd` for compatibility) to bad parts of `antd`.
